B:Lession O1
T:
 :			Welcome to lesson O1.
 :
 :In the O series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the one-hand
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :You must always type two or more key sequences, the time between the keys must
 :be lesser than 1s. (Press now 54 :)
 :What 54 is depends of your loaded keyboard mapping, fa. 'sa'.

T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and 
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit 21 for the RETURN key.  To do this,
 :type 2 with the middle finger followed by 1 with first finger.  Remember you
 :should type it fast!  Also, be careful not to type an extra space at the 
 :end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.
 :
 :Remember to press SPACE=54 to continue, ESC=89 to quit.

T:
 :			ALE ONE-HAND KEYBOARD
 :
 :For this one-hand keyboard two keys are combined to a single key. To get Y
 :you must press on the number-pad the 4 and than the 3 (right hand mode)
 :or the 2 and than the 9 (rotated mode). Or 'a' and than 'c', if you use the
 :left side keyboard mapping.
 :
 :The pause between the keys shouldn't be greater than 1s. If you aren't able
 :to type at that speed, this time can be increased in the configuration.
 :
 :If you don't know, if you must type the first or second key, wait 2 seconds,
 :this resets the keyboard to its normal state.
 :
 :For the remainder of this lesson I only write the right hand codes.
 :The right hand code for RETURN is 21, The rotated mode codes are rotated by 90°
 :(1=7,2=4,3=1, ...).
 :Don't forget the code for RETURN is 21, middle finger followed by ring finger
 :lower row)
 :
 :Remember to press SPACE=54 to continue, ESC=89 to quit.

I:Type N (78) six times with the ring finger followed by the middle finger on
 :the upper row. (Don't forget the 21 for RETURN on lower row)
